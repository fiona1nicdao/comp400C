import java.util.Stack;

/*
 * A) Write a method that takes in a Stack and prints the elements in reverse order,
 *     while keeping the original stack unchanged (at the end of the process)
 *      Example input: [1,2,3,4]
 *      Example output: 4,3,2,1
 * B) Write a method that inserts an element into the stack at a specific index (assume
 *     that the element with index 0 is at the bottom of the stack)
 *      Example input: [1,2,3,5[, index=3, value=4 
 *       Example output: [1,2,3,4,5[
 * C) Write a method that returns the smallest index of an element in a stack
 *      Example input: [1,2,3,4,1,2,3[, value=3
 *      Example output: 2
 * D) Write a method that uses a stack to determine if a string is a palindrome or not
 *      Example input: "racecar"
 *      Example output: true
